## Play the game
After the initial light wandering sequence (yellow and then blue), one of the 4 corner LEDs wil blink in blue while the status LEDs (the two middle ones) are blue.
Then the status LEDs turn green and it's waiting with a 6 second timeout for a touch.
You now have to touch the corresponding buttons in the right sequence (they light up blue if the touch got registered).
Each round will add a press so the game gets more and more challanging.
