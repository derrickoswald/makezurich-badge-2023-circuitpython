# Getting started guide for Grove SEN5X All in One

This guide explains how to successfully connect the Grove SEN5X All in One sensor
to the Make Zürich badge.

## Required Python libraries

### Adafruit

Go to [https://circuitpython.org/libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)
and [download the bundle for version 8.x](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/download/20230604/adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-8.x-mpy-20230604.zip).
Unzip the bundle and copy `adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-8.x-mpy-20230604/lib/adafruit_logging.mpy` to
`CIRCUITPY/lib/adafruit_logging.mpy`.

### Sensirion
#### Pre-compiled versions with modifications added
For convinience during MakeZürich, precompiled versions of the two modified sensirion libraries have been added to the /lib folder in the root of this repository.

If you are using those, you can skip the manual steps.

Keep in mind that for the long run someone needs to step up and build / maintain a proper library and possibly add it to the adafruit library pack.

#### Manually checkout and modify
The author of this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Sensirion/python-i2c-sen5x/issues/3)
forked two GitHub repositories from Sensirion and implemented modifications to make
the two required Python libraries compatible with [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/).

As a reference, these are the two forked repositories and the relevant pull requests:

* [https://github.com/good-enough-technology/CircuitPython_sensirion_i2c_driver](https://github.com/good-enough-technology/CircuitPython_sensirion_i2c_driver)
* [https://github.com/good-enough-technology/CircuitPython_sensirion_i2c_sen5x](https://github.com/good-enough-technology/CircuitPython_sensirion_i2c_sen5x)
* [https://github.com/Sensirion/python-i2c-driver/compare/master...good-enough-technology:python-i2c-driver:master](https://github.com/Sensirion/python-i2c-driver/compare/master...good-enough-technology:python-i2c-driver:master)
* [https://github.com/Sensirion/python-i2c-sen5x/compare/master...good-enough-technology:circuitpython-i2c-sen5x:master](https://github.com/Sensirion/python-i2c-sen5x/compare/master...good-enough-technology:circuitpython-i2c-sen5x:master)

To obtain the required copy, clone the two repositories:

```shell
git clone --branch master --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/good-enough-technology/CircuitPython_sensirion_i2c_driver.git
git clone --branch master --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/good-enough-technology/CircuitPython_sensirion_i2c_sen5x.git
```

Modify `CircuitPython_sensirion_i2c_sen5x/sensirion_i2c_sen5x/commands/generated.py`
on line 1129:

```python
- firmware_debug = bool(unpack(">?", checked_data[2:3])[0])  # bool
+ firmware_debug = bool(unpack(">B", checked_data[2:3])[0])  # bool
```

Copy the two directories to `CIRCUITPY/lib`:

```shell
cp -av CircuitPython_sensirion_i2c_driver/sensirion_i2c_driver CIRCUITPY/lib
cp -av CircuitPython_sensirion_i2c_sen5x/sensirion_i2c_sen5x CIRCUITPY/lib
```

## Test the sensor

Use the provided cable to connect the sensor to the `I2C1` port on the badge.
Refer to the [pinout](https://github.com/makezurich/makezurich-badge-2023/blob/main/makezurich2023-badge-pinout.png) to find the right location on the badge.

Read the address from the back of the Grove All-in-one Environmental Sensor and
set it as the value of the `SEN5X_DEFAULT_ADDRESS` variable in the `main.py` script:

```python
SEN5X_DEFAULT_ADDRESS = 0x69  # The actual address might differ
```

Copy the `main.py` CircuitPython script to `CIRCUITPY`.

The output should be similar to this:

```shell
